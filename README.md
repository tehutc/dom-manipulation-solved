## GETTING STARTED
- Clone this repository.
- Create a new repository in your Github account. Set it to be a public repo. Copy the new repo SSH path.
- Open the cloned repo project in your favorite IDE. Start a terminal session.
- Update/change the remote origin path with to the new SSH path **OR** add a new path (f.i "solved" or "destination"). [Github's git remote actions docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories).
- Push the main/master branch to the new repository.
- Run the Live Server with the "Go Live" button in the bottom right panel of VSCode.
- Make sure to watch the intro video before you start.

## BEFORE YOU START
- Make sure to watch the two INTRO videos before you start: 
  * [END OF EXERCISE EXPECTATIONS VIDEO](https://www.loom.com/share/83055c83ee8f4838bc7b04b86d8d1844)
  * [REPO CONTENTS DESCRIPTION VIDEO](https://www.loom.com/share/d09fb1c4653d496d9439c12b997a008d)
- There are 3 pages in the **pages** folder. They are all set to work properly if the code is written correctly in the files of the **exercises** folder and do NOT require any changes/updates
- The **exercise-info** folder contains the information about the methods and documentation pieces you will use when solving the tasks. Please make sure to pay attention to what is asked before you start the exercise in the exercise file.
- The exercise files (the only files you can change or update) are in the **exercises** folder.

## HOW IT WORKS
- Here is the order of going through the exercises:
  * moving-items
  * sorting-items
  * local-storage 
- The grading mentor will download your assignment, then start the live server and check if everything works as shown in the INTRO video. The mentor also makes sure that no files have changed except for the files in the exercise folder.
- **!!! Nothing is restricted to be used (loops, applicatives, any other methods). The only thing the mentor pays attention to if everything works as shown in the video and the exercise files' code follows all the requirements listed**

### CAUTION
Please, do **NOT** change or update:

- Functions' arguments or their names. Use exactly the name used in examples.
- Lines of code that are asked NOT to change or delete.
- Commented out lines of text that initially were in the files.
- Files in the css folder.
- Files in the pages folder.
- Files in the exercises-info folder.

You can only write your code in the "Your code goes here..." placeholder in each exercise file of the **exercises** folder.

Changing the files listed above may cause NOT meeting all the acceptance criteria.
You can add/commit any repo changes any time you want, but if you haven't added, committed any changes you can always 
restore those file's initial state with ```git restore <fileName>``` command.

### HOW TO SUBMIT
- Make sure your code works as shown in the INTRO video
- Commit and push the changes to your repository (the one you have created on step 2 of GETTING STARTED).
- Submit the txt file with a repo link on the exercise page in Devslopes course.
